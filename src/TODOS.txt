plans for app:

display actual weather data from store
display a loading state
make buttons actually do the forecast
display weather icons based on condition
show a card view for each weather update
move buttons from top bar
make the effect work with getting the browser geolocation data

*****************************************************

for now lets just mess with the state. I should also decide which data I want from the weather data. I should probabaly
make an object for which data I want.

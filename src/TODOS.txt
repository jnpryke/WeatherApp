plans for app:

display a loading state
make buttons actually do the forecast
get browser geolocation data for weather query
5 day forecast (refactor the store)
have end to end testing karma
connect btn to ngrx Celcius to/from fahrenheit (lets do this one, lets save the state of the selection in the browser)
move weather location name to the top bar

*****************************************************

lets save a default value then let the user update the value from the button press. Well I think I will have to use the emitter to
emit from the top bar to effect the change
